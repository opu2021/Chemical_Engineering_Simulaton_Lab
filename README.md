# Chemical_Engineering_Simulaton_Lab
Course Work
This is our core courses in our Chemical Engineering.The objective of the course is to introduce the student with a technical computing software (e.g. MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, PYTHON, SCILAB) and a chemical engineering process simulation software (e.g. DWSIM) for solving chemical engineering problems.
The laboratory exercises are intended to help the student leverage technical computation and process simulation software for chemical engineering applications, addressing situations wherein solutions to problems could be intractable with analytical methods. This will involve concurrently introducing chemical engineering concepts, relevant numerical methods along with technical computing.
